        <p>JAK was created to satisfy the need to standartize and streamline JavaScript application development. It provides tools that address frequently recurring types of needs. JAK has been written with respect to the following principles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Do not create too complex constructions and rules</li>
            <li>Modify the JavaScript "runtime" environment in the least possible way</li>
            <li>Encapsulate own functionality, i.e. use own "namespace"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>JAK solves:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Detection of the client and environment</li>
            <li>Working with events</li>
            <li>Working with DOM and HTML</li>
            <li>Working with XMLHTTPREQUEST</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition to that JAK provides advaced OOP tools:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating classes</li>
            <li>Simple implementation of inheritance</li>
            <li>Creating complex structured applications</li>
            <li>Creating and handling of own events</li>
        </ul>
        <p>JAK is completely documented using the JSDoc Toolkit.</p>
        <p>JAK has been derived from the Mapy.cz project and is now being used by most web services provided by Seznam.cz</p>
        <p>JAK supports the following modern web browsers: Internet Explorer 8+, Firefox 3.5+ (and browsers using the same Gecko engine), Google Chrome, Safari 4+ and Opera 10+.</p>
